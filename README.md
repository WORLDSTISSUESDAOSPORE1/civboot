# Civboot: a civilizational bootstrapper

This is the repository for Civboot: a Civilizational Bootstrapper. It's purpose
is to act as a version-controlled wiki for all efforts related to Civboot.

This effort was started on 2019-11-14 and is still very early stage. This
github repo should be used for discussion (through [opening an issue][issue]).

I have also started a podcast. View it on [youtube][CB youtube] or listen on
[anchor][CB anchor] or wherever you get your podcasts.

## Introduction
For the past several decades the complexity of technology has continuously
outpaced our ability to understand and replicate it from a first principles
understanding. Not only does this leave humanity itself vulnerable to an outage
of the internet or the global supply chain, it also harms our ability to
understand the core technology of our civilization and violates the
philosophical principle that civilization itself should have ownership of the
building blocks which form it. Civboot gives humanity a place to start over --
to rethink how technology should be built from first principles as well as a
place which can be improved for the benefit of all.

A **Civboot** is a civilizational bootstrapper, meaning it contains all essential
components necessary to build and improve itself using only knowledge and tools
contained within itself. In other words, it is the set of tools and knowledge
necessary to design, modify and build all components that modern civilization
depends on such as computers, motors, machinery, metals, electronic displays,
buildings, air conditioners, energy generation, energy storage, etc. It must be
able to achieve this using only raw materials, human involvement and the tools
and knowledge contained within itself.

It is important to note what it is _not_. Civboot is _not_ a set of guides on
how to start with _only_ raw materials and then create complex technology. For
example, it is NOT starting with just sand, coal and iron ore and manufacturing
a forge -- it is starting with a forge (and other tools) and manufacturing a
forge using raw materials.

Civboot is and must remain completely free and open. In order to fulfill its
mission, it must be possible to understand every level of its design -- from
materials science, to manufacturing process, to mechanics, to the computer
hardware and software it is running. Included information and processes should
be as simple as possible -- these concepts should be easy to learn and
replicate. This constraint will force simplification of the designs, ideas and
software being included. We must take our complicated technology stack and work
on distilling it to its essentials, then rebuild upon those essentials to be
even more efficient and simple.

This project is NOT an attempt to "do this at home." Creating the first Civboot
will no doubt require millions of dollars and the efforts of thousands of
individuals to design, experiment, document and simplify a huge range of
technologies which cross an extremely broad range of disciplines. The first
Civboot will likely be made "distributed" -- with teams from all over the world
sending their products to each other, collaborating on multiple different
approaches. The hope is to get hackers, professionals, retired experts,
academia and organizational support to help distill civilization's knowledge
into a stack that can be understood and self replicated.

This document is the first rough-draft to define what a Civboot is and why we
want one.

## Why A Civboot is Needed
The power of technology has been on a rapid upward trend and has lead to an
expansive growth of wealth and well being for humanity. However, as the power
has grown the complexity has grown with it -- the point that it is no longer
possible for even a large group with extensive resource to recreate the
building blocks of civilization. This leads to the four major problems which
Civboot can solve which are around education, innovation, ownership and risk
management.

The first problem has to do with education. It is now impossible for even a
group of 1000 or more individuals to learn and replicate the technology stack
which civilization depends on. This makes education more theoretical and less
hands on, as well as discouraging learning through experimentation.

The second problem has to do with the philosophy of ownership. As it is, the
core building blocks of civilization (primarily: computer hardware) are
controlled by a few large corporations. It is not possible for a community or
buisness to take ownership of this technology unless they devote multiple
billions of dollars to the effort. This is still true (but less so) of other
areas of the stack, even most open source software can only be compiled and run
by using binaries which can only run on proprietary hardware.

The third problem has to do with innovation. Because the technology stack is
so complex and expensive, you have to be a billionare to even attempt to
verticly integrate any piece of it for innovation. For decades the space
industry stagnated and even regressed until SpaceX verticly integrated and
innovated on every component inhouse. Trying to do this for computers would be
next to impossible.

The forth problem has to do with risk. As technology and the supply chain get
more and more complex and intertwinted it becomes increasingly difficult to
adapt to hard changes. What would happen if most major silicone fabrication
facilities were destroyed? How would we adapt if there was a disruption to
the worldwide internet? If there were a world war which lasted for 10 years,
would civilization be able to recover, having not been able to build consumer
hardware during that time? 

Computers are unreliable things and the only way to build them at the
complexity modern civilization demands is to use more computers to control
their fabrication. Modern software is compiled using large binaries which were
obtained and stored from a previous compiler. It is no longer possible to
"start from scratch" on a huge percentage of what makes modern civilization
what it is, which means that a disruption to any part of this chain may be
unrecoverable.

## Goals
The Civboot dream is that any group of 500 or more individuals could be freely
given the tools and knowledge necessary to create the building blocks of modern
civilization.  There are five "levels" of achievement in this plan. Attaining a
certain level does not require deprecating the previous one, in fact each level
should work to improve and build upon the levels below it to make them simpler
and easier to understand.

These are the 5 Civboot levels:

- A level 1 Civboot would allow every human community to have ownership of the
  technology needed for a modern civilization as we know it today. It is what
  was described previously in this document.
- A level 2 "Eco" Civboot would provide cheap renewable energy to help guard
  against ecological collapse in the next 100+ years.
- A level 3 "Bioboot" Civboot would provide automated verticle/greenhouse
  farming and nearly guarantee that human flourishing could continue far into
  the future, and prevent ecological collapse permanently.
- A level 4 "Tunnel" Civboot would guard against nearly any kind of
  extermination event that did not seriously damage the earth's crust while
  also improving our ability to coexist with the ecosystem even further.
- A level 5 "Space"  Civboot would mean humanity is a fully open space faring
  civilization.

Each level represents the different aspirations which Civboot strives for. Its
primary goal is to be a repository of tools and knolwedge which allows any
group of people to learn and understand every layer of technology upon which
civilization can be built, with aspirations about what the future of
civilization _can_ be.

The full definition of each level is defined below

- **Level 0 - Today**: this is where we are right now. The tools and knowledge
  to build civilization theoretically exists, as we are living in a global
  civilization that uses those tools and knowledge to recreate and improve
  itself.
- **Level 0+ - demonstrated layers**: each layer of a finished Civboot should
  be demonstrated, using technology which is expected to be possible from the
  layers below it.
  - For example, creating a CPU fab will take a long time -- so developing
    software that is expected to work on the future self-made hardware should
    be done first 
  - Documentation may be scattered, but the hope should be to simplify as much
    as possible at this stage to make level 1 smoother.

- **Level 1 - First Civboot**: the creation of a Civboot, which is capable of
  recreating itself using only itself along with 500 untrained individuals,
  given raw materials and 5 years of focused time
  - Likely very basic technology using extremely simple design
  - Represents a distillation of current knowledge into what is necessary to
    build civilization from scratch.

- **Level 2 - Eco Civboot**: a Civboot which uses only renewable energy and
  can recycle 90% or more of (at least) its own components
  - Builds on Level 1 with some more complex but productive processes,
    requiring more expertise
  - Caps increased to 1000 focused untrained individuals and 5 years

- **Level 3 - Bioboot** which can provide near autonomous agriculture and
  recycle organic matter (aka waste) from human sources and loses 95%+ less
  water than conventional agriculture
  - Allows for self sufficiency and ecological sustainability nearly anywhere
    on the surface of the planet in a variety of ecological conditions
  - Further builds upon level 2, likely requiring some form of machine learning
    and automation using (at least) visual recognition -- such as automated
    vertical farms
  - Caps increased to 1500 focused untrained individuals and 7 years

- **Level 4 - Tunnel Civboot**: a Civboot which can support a colony of 30,000
  people living underground with 99%+ recycling of all materials the
  civilization needs including materials as well as food, water, air and 100%
  renewable energy.
  - Essentially a refinement of Level 3 with some additional technology (i.e.
    tunnel making, mining, more automation, etc)
  - This could be used as a foundation for "spaceship earth", giving all humans
    the capability to live in a way which does not interact with the ecosystem,
    allowing better conservation and nearly guaranteeing that human existence
    can continue.
  - Caps increased to 3000 focused untrained individuals and 10 years

- **Level 5 - Space Civboot:** contains all necessary technology for a
  civilization to live permanently on another celestial body as well as
  transport a new Civboot & colony from one planet to another (i.e. reusable
  rockets)
  - Builds on Level 4 and represents a truly massive accumulation of open
    knowledge and tools.
  - Caps increased to 10,000 focused untrained individuals and 15 years.


## Non Goals

Civboot does not have an expressly political goal except to democratize the
tools and knowledge necessary for the building blocks of civilization. Notably,
it is not trying to put an end to proprietary tools or knowledge, but is rather
creating a solid foundation upon which new tools and knowledge (whether open or
proprietary) can be built.

Civboot is not a criticism of the history of technological development to date,
but rather a purpose statement which hopes to focus on the basics in order to
foster understanding and greater sharing of knowledge and technology in the
future.

Civboot is not a for-profit effort. It is not controlled by a single individual
or group. Any person or group has the right to attempt to build multiple
different kinds of Civboots and call them a Civboot, provided they meet the
spirit of the general philosophy of what a Civboot is.

Civboot is not something which is intended to put any company out of business,
especially in the near term. For instance, even if creating a computer using an
open technology stack is _possible_, it doesn't mean that it will be cheaper or
in any way out-compete most commercial products. Commercial products will
continue to compete with the Civboot technology stack, and they will probably
outcompete it in all areas, in the near to long term. Once Civboot _does_
outcompete commercial products, it will be a testament to the democratization
of technology, which is the next logical step from the current
commoditization of it, and at that point should be celebrated.

## Constraints

The intent of these constraints is to limit the amount of tools and information
included in a Civboot into a manageable amount. These constraints (whether
included or excluded) make no judgement about the importance of said items
except as to apply to the goal of creating a Level 1 Civboot. Different Civboot
levels modify some of these constraints.


- **Must** be entirely free and open.
  - **Must** not contain proprietary or hidden designs, i.e. no "binary blobs"
- **Must** be possible to build itself from itself
  - Requires no outside knowledge besides the language which the guides are
    written in
  - Requires no outside tooling besides commonly found materials (rocks, clay,
    wood, dirt, sand, ore, etc)
- **Must** include all foundational knowledge necessary to understand every
  component and their interactions.
  - **Must** include the theory and practice of math, physics, chemistry,
    materials science, computer design and programming, etc necessary to
    explain the design of every component in the system such that it can be
    replicated and have improvements made upon it.
  - **Must not** include information not necessary to understand or begin
    improvements upon the system. Aka must not include politics, history,
    medicine, philosophy, religion, art, psychology, sociology or any branch of
    human knowledge or endeavor outside of the sciences and engineering
    necessary to understand and improve the system. These are important to
    preserve, but it is not the goal of Civboot to preserve them.
    - Civboot **should** aid in providing the technology to store and view such
      knowledge where possible.
  - **May** include some amount of history of
    math/science/engineering/philosophy which is required to properly
    understand a component.
- **Should** be as simple as possible but no simpler.
  - Comfort has almost no importance, unless it hinders use excessively
  - Easy as possible to re-learn and re-create from near-scratch
- **Should** be as efficient as possible
  - Require as few materials / space / energy necessary to achieve its purpose.
    Improvements to these areas without increasing complexity should be
    accepted.
- **Should** focus on the "single city" design
  - Local communication protocols acceptable
  - Globalized transportation / communication not required (but allowed)
- **Should** be composed of modifiable and swappable designs
  - Stack will continue to improve in both simplicity and effectiveness -- no
    stage in stack should block this improvement
  - Stack should be upgradeable as components become simpler and more efficient
  - May include multiple (swappable) alternatives to perform same role with
    different tradeoffs
- **Should not** include knowledge or tools just for the sake of those who
  build it
  - For example, although the people working on a new Civboot need to eat,
    farming equipment and practices should not be included (except in L3+).
  - Some equipment, like a bulldozer/truck, have multiple purposes and so can
    be included.
  - Civboot **should** enable the storage/retrieval of such knowledge and
    construction of such tools


## Progress

The following is an effort to compile what is needed to construct a Level 1
Civboot.

**General Tools and Equipment (non computer)**: See
[Open Source Ecology](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/) for current work on many of
these designs. These two movements share a lot in common.

- Human Tools and Equipment:
 - Hand tools: saw, hammer, axe, shovel, pickaxe, etc
 - Powered hand tools: drill, rotary saw, soldering iron, etc
 - Vehicles: tractor, bulldozer, etc
- Manufacturing:
  - Materials creation: blast furnace, forge, brick builder, plastic (like)
    material synthesis, etc 
  - Fabrication: CNC machine, 3D printer (multi-material), lathe, etc
- Energy:
  - Power Usage: electric motor (+generator)
  - Power Generation: Steam generator, wind
  - Power Storage: battery, steam storage, gravity storage

**Computer Hardware**: the computer hardware manufactured will likely be
extremely limited compared to modern computer hardware.
- [podcast 0002][podcast 0002] ([show notes](podcasts/0002-semiconductor_fabrication.md))
  focused on whether pure silicone can be produced.
- Basic requirements are to either simply the processing of Silicone (i.e.
  [silicone grains][silicone grains]) and/or find a better process such as
  [nanotube CPU][nanotube CPU]. See also [this][DARPA 3DSoC CNFET] and
  [this][CNFET in factories].
- This is the hardest piece of a civboot.
- Once circuits can be constructed, the RISC-V (TODO: add link) processor is
  likely the best target for Civboot. The z80 should not be overlooked for
  initial designs though, as it requires only 9000 transistors to be produced
  for a moderately capable CPU.

**Computer Software**: CollapseOS.org gives a pretty good idea of how to get software
bootstrapped on basic hardware using only a few hundred lines of assembly and
forth code. That OS fits on less than 5k, requires no binary blobs, and can cross
compile to several other architectures. The Forth programming language is a
primary driver of this simplicity. A (forth) compiler, basic file system, text
editor, assembler and cross compiler was written largely by a single
individual and runs on a computer chip with <9000 transistors from the 1970's.

The basic language stack for software is currently imagined to be:

1.  Forth OS / bootloader largely paralleling CollapseOS's design
1.  WASM compiler and WASI runtime written in Forth.
1.  Scheme stage0 compiler (to wasm) written in forth. Scheme has many of the
    benefits of forth, where the compiler can "walk" very early using only a few
    primitives. [Schism](https://github.com/google/schism) seems like a good
    target with it's focus on an ultra-simple stage0 compiler and the fact it
    targets WASM.
1.  (possibly) A fully functional language, possibly Clojure, written in Scheme which
    compiles to wasm/wasi.
1.  A language with safety and runtime features similar to rust, who's compiler
    is written in Scheme or Clojure. Currently considering reimplementing
    [Carp](https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp). This could emit wasm/wasi OR machine
    code and could be used to construct a stage1 OS.

Items 4 and 5 are likely only possible if the hardware is sufficiently
advanced. Therefore early focus should be on forth + wasm + scheme. Using
primarily Forth and scheme the following should be constructed:

- Filesystem, memory manager, shell, etc. does not have to adhere to POSIX or
  any such standard.
- A vim-like text editor but with emacs-like extensibilty. A huge percentage of
  software can be built using such a system as the primary interface.
- TODO: CAD, circuit layout, chip design, communication, etc etc
