# CivBoot

This is the repository for Civboot: a Civilizational Bootstrapper. It's purpose
is to act as a version-controlled wiki for all efforts related to Civboot.

This effort was started on 2019-11-14 and is still very early stage. This
github repo should be used for discussion (through [opening an issue][issue]).
See [civboot.org] (or the [civboot-doc] if that is down) for the current
philosophy and approach.

Soon to come:
* A podcast
* Migrate the google doc to markdown, flush out the wiki
