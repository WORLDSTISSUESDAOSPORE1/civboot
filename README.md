# CivBoot

This is the repository for Civboot: a Civilizational Bootstrapper. It's purpose is to act as a version-controlled wiki for all efforts related to Civboot.

This effort was started on 2019-11-14 and is still very early stage. This github repo should be used for
discussion (through [opening an issue][issue]). See civboot.org for the current philosophy and approach.


Soon to come:
* A podcast
* Migrate the google doc to markdown, flush out the wiki
