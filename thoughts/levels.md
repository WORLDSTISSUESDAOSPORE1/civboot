When I first created Civboot I envisioned there would be multiple "levels",
with level 1 being the "core" one of being able to self-replicate it. I still
feel this way, but the talk of multiple levels probably confuses the early
contributor.

- A level 1 Civboot is what the [README](../README.md) states: it allows 500
  motivated students to have a working understanding of the foundations of
  modern civilization.
- A level 2 "Eco" Civboot would be able to run on only cheap renewable energy
  produced by itself. This could be through solar cells or more likely wind
  energy and heat reclaimation through an Organic Rankine Engine or similar.
- A level 3 "Bioboot" Civboot would provide automated verticle/greenhouse
  farming and nearly guarantee that human flourishing could continue far into the
  future without significant damage to the natural ecosystem.
- A level 4 "Tunnel" Civboot would guard against nearly any kind of
  extermination event that did not seriously damage the earth's crust while also
  improving our ability to coexist with the ecosystem even further.
- A level 5 "Space"  Civboot would mean a Civboot can build its own reusable
  rockets. It would mean humanity is a fully open-source space faring
  civilization.

Each level represents the different aspirations which Civboot strives for. Its
primary goal is to be a repository of tools and knolwedge which allows any
group of people to learn and understand every layer of technology upon which
civilization can be built, with aspirations about what the future of
civilization _can_ be.

The full definition of each level is defined below

- **Level 0 - Today**: this is where we are right now. The tools and knowledge
  to build civilization theoretically exists, as we are living in a global
  civilization that uses those tools and knowledge to recreate and improve
  itself.
- **Level 0+ - demonstrated layers**: each layer of a finished Civboot should
  be demonstrated, using technology which is expected to be possible from the
  layers below it.
  - For example, creating a CPU fab will take a long time -- so developing
    software that is expected to work on the future self-made hardware should
    be done first 
  - Documentation may be scattered, but the hope should be to simplify as much
    as possible at this stage to make level 1 smoother.

- **Level 1 - First Civboot**: the creation of a Civboot, which is capable of
  recreating itself using only itself.
  - Likely very basic technology using extremely simple design
  - Represents a distillation of current knowledge into what is necessary to
    build civilization from scratch.

- **Level 2 - Eco Civboot**: a Civboot which uses only renewable energy and
  can recycle 90% or more of (at least) its own components
  - Builds on Level 1 with some more complex but productive processes,
    requiring more expertise
  - Caps increased to 1000 at least double the students and an extra year to
    build.

- **Level 3 - Bioboot** which can provide near autonomous agriculture and
  recycle organic matter (aka waste) from human sources and loses 95%+ less
  water than conventional agriculture
  - Allows for self sufficiency and ecological sustainability nearly anywhere
    on the surface of the planet in a variety of ecological conditions
  - Further builds upon level 2, likely requiring some form of machine learning
    and automation using (at least) visual recognition -- such as automated
    vertical farms
  - Caps increased to 1500 focused untrained individuals and 7 years

- **Level 4 - Tunnel Civboot**: a Civboot which can support a colony of 30,000
  people living underground with 99%+ recycling of all materials the
  civilization needs including materials as well as food, water, air and 100%
  renewable energy.
  - Essentially a refinement of Level 3 with some additional technology (i.e.
    tunnel making, mining, more automation, etc)
  - This could be used as a foundation for "spaceship earth", giving all humans
    the capability to live in a way which does not interact with the ecosystem,
    allowing better conservation and nearly guaranteeing that human existence
    can continue.
  - Caps increased to 3000 focused untrained individuals and 10 years

- **Level 5 - Space Civboot:** contains all necessary technology for a
  civilization to live permanently on another celestial body as well as
  transport a new Civboot & colony from one planet to another (i.e. reusable
  rockets)
  - Builds on Level 4 and represents a truly massive accumulation of open
    knowledge and tools.
  - Caps increased to 10,000 focused untrained individuals and 15 years.
