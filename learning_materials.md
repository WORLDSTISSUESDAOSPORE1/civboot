Just a collection of reading materials for learning Civboot related concepts


Software:
- [Programming from the ground up][1]: Excellent introductory guide to how
  computers work. Starts teaching programming by teaching assembly. Highly
  recommended for beginners.
- For folks who have never learned a programming language before I recommend
  [Learn Python the Hard Way][3]. Or you can jump right into [Starting
  Forth][4].
  - Reason: python is an excellent language for prototyping your ideas as well
    as writing test suites. It is _not_ a language targeted by Civboot (Forth
    is).
- [The Lost Art of Structure Packing][2]: good guide to how C-structs are
  defined, which is good for low-level thinking in software.
