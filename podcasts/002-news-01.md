I ended up recording and publishing just one podcast in the past several
months, and that was because of numerous life and societal events.

- Covid broke out, my wife was pregnant and I cared for our two kids
- We just had a baby

Civboot offers an educational benefit as well as the possibility of a stronger
global supply chain. COVID might demonstrate why that is necessary.

The benefit of having a shorter, simpler and more transparent technology stack
prevents major catastrophe if the supply chain should be disrupted. There are
several important benefits to a world-wide economy and supply network,
and I am strongly in support of both for the purpose of both cost savings and wealth
distribution. However, I am also in favor of simpler and more understandable
technology along with more robustness in said technology.

This is what I believe a Civboot, and related efforts, can provide -- and makes it
especially worth-while in light of the response to the COVID pandemic which
most heavily affected goods and services which depended on the global economy.
