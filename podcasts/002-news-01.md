I ended up recording and publishing just one podcast, and that was because of
numerous life and societal events.

- Covid broke out, my wife was pregnant and I cared for our two kids
- We just had a baby

I believe over the comming months (and possibly years) that the response to COVID
will demonstrate why a Civboot is necessary -- having a global supply chain where
it is not easy to produce components necessary for civilization locally can threaten
the stabilility of civilization. 

Along with all of a Civboot's eductional benefits, which are certainly the primary
reason to pursue one, the benefit of having a shorter, simpler and more transparent
technology stack prevents major catastrophe if that supply chain should be disrupted.
There are several important benefits to a world-wide economy and supply network,
and I am strongly in support of both for the purpose of both cost savings and wealth
distribution. However, I am also in favor of simpler and more understandable
technology along with more robustness in said technology.

This is what I believe a Civboot, and related efforts, can provide -- and makes it
especially worth-while in light of the response to the COVID pandemic which
most heavily affected goods and services which depended on the global economy.
